## Machine Learning Sessions

Documenting my first contact with Machine Learning. Following tutorials made by [Tech with Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python) Youtube channel.

Folders are dividing the type of algorithm used in each case. Scikit-Learn module is used to implement all the models. 

1. Classification
    - K-Nearest Neighbors
    - Support Vector Machines
2. Regression
    - Linear Regression

3. Clustering

### Neural Networks Examples

Using TensorFlow module, I explored how basic neural networks are built, and produced some examples:

**Clothes Classification**
